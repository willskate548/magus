.. _did-expression-1:

Regular expression
------------------

| This is a regular expression to tariff the DID depending on who is calling it.
| Lets analyze a real example:
|     Suppose we want to charge 0.10 when we receive a call from a landline and 0.20 if its a mobile phone and block any other format.
|     In this example we will create rules to identify the CallerID in the format 0 + area code + number, area code + number, or 55 + area code + number.
| 
|     Take a look at the following image on what the result would look like:
|

   :scale: 100% 
| 
| 
|     Regular expression for mobile
|     ^[1-9][0-9]9\\d{8}$|^0[1-9][0-9]9\\d{8}$|^55[1-9][0-9]9\\d{8}$
| 
|     Regular expression for landline
|     ^[1-9][0-9]\\d{8}$|^0[1-9][0-9]\\d{8}$|^55[1-9][0-9]\\d{8}$
